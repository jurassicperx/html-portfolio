<h1>My Personal Movie Reviews</h1>

<h2> A list of my top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Grown Ups</h3>
<p>The most conforting and fun comedy. Best picture to unwind on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Evoluion</h3>
<p>My go-to Saturday morning movie. Makes my day go better.</p>

<h3>Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World</h3>
<p>Best movie to watch at night. Takes me back to the good old days when all I used to do was sit at home, eat cheese sticks and watch this sick ass movie.</p>
